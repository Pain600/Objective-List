# Objective-List

This program was coded in the IntelliJ Idea that uses node.js and all other languages required to complete this task.In this program I used CSS,HTML,and JavaScript as requested.
Also material design principles have been used for scalability on both desktop and mobile.
I have also inserted a background image and data that can be edited by the user. 
The webpage does as requested and makes the user add objectives to the page.
The user can click on the add button to add more objectives or they could click on the close button that removes the current selected item. 
It is also possible to hover over these objectives and they wil change colour giving the the page a vibrant look and feel to it.
The amount of times that the user can add their objectives is limitless. Also the design of the page makes it very easy for the user to access.
